Certainly! Here's a simple, yet heartfelt poem for you:

```
In the quiet of the night, under the moon's soft glow,
Whispers of the wind carry tales of love and woe.
Stars above, they twinkle bright, in the vast, dark sky,
Guiding dreams and hopes, in the soft, silent night.
 
The river flows, a gentle song, in the heart of the land,
Carrying stories of the past, in its gentle, flowing band.
Trees stand tall, a silent guard, in the heart of the wood,
Sheltering life, in their ancient, timeless, silent stand.

In the quiet moments, when the world seems to pause,
We find our peace, in the simple, beautiful, silent cause.
So, let's cherish every moment, every breath we take,
For in the quiet, we find the beauty, the strength, the heart's sweet ache.
```
